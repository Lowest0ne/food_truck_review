It is important that we follow a convension when collaborting with github.
The most important thing is that we never push directly to the master branch here.
It also helps if you never edit the files on your own master branch.  Only edit files on a feature branch.

I decided that adding your name to the repo would be a good first exersice

* Fork this repo, and clone your fork onto your computer
* checkout a feature branch and add your name to this README.rdoc
* commit the changes, and push that branch to github: 'git push origin feature-branch'
* go to github and open a pull request.
* When the pull request is accepted, you can safely delete your feature branch from github
* back in the terminal switch to the master branch
* type 'git remote add upstream https://github.com/Lowest0ne/food_truck_review.git'
* type 'git fetch upstream'
* type 'git merge upstream/master'
* Your master branch should now include your name in the README
* to verify this, typing 'git merge feature-branch' should result in something like 'up to date'
* You can safely delete your feature branch
* type 'git push' to update your repo on github

I know that is a lot of steps, but by following these conventions, we will reduce the chances of breaking things
